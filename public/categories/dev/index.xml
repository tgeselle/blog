      <description>Interested in creating a KakaoTalk Chat Bot or explore their APIs but unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t read nor speak Korean? Well, this is the place for you.
I recently discovered KakaoTalk via a couple of South Korean friends that use it for their daily communication. Unfortunately, one of them recently moved to the US and still has a bit of difficulty with communicating in English. As a non-native english speaker, I remember how long it took me to learn it and I wished I just had a quick way to still chat with my friends without having to go on Google Translate every 5 seconds to understand what they are writing.</description>
